# Fixed Navigation Issues - Summary

## Issues Identified and Resolved:

### 1. **Duplicate Signal Name Error** âœ… FIXED
**Error**: `Duplicate signal name: invalid override of property change signal or superclass signal`

**Root Cause**: 
- Custom `selectedSubredditChanged` signal was conflicting with QML's automatically generated property change signal
- QML automatically creates a `propertyNameChanged` signal for every property

**Solution**:
- Removed the manual `signal selectedSubredditChanged(string subreddit)` declaration
- Updated the code to rely on the automatic property change signal
- Updated signal emission to just set the property (QML handles the signal automatically)

### 2. **Component Type Unavailable Error** âœ… FIXED
**Error**: `Type OptionSelector unavailable`

**Root Cause**:
- Naming conflict between our custom `OptionSelector` component and QML's built-in `OptionSelector`
- QML was trying to use the built-in component instead of our custom one

**Solution**:
- Renamed custom component from `OptionSelector.qml` to `CategorySelector.qml`
- Updated `SettingsPage.qml` to use `CategorySelector` instead of `OptionSelector`
- Updated comments and references accordingly
- Removed old file from build directory

## Files Modified:

1. **`/home/suraj/memesapp/qml/components/OptionSelector.qml`** â†’ **`CategorySelector.qml`**
   - Removed duplicate signal declaration
   - Updated signal emission logic
   - Renamed file to avoid naming conflict

2. **`/home/suraj/memesapp/qml/SettingsPage.qml`**
   - Changed `OptionSelector` to `CategorySelector`
   - Updated component references

3. **Build directory cleanup**
   - Removed old `OptionSelector.qml` from build directory
   - Copied updated files to build location

## Navigation Flow Now Working:

âœ… **Settings Button Click** â†’ Triggers Action without errors  
âœ… **Component Creation** â†’ SettingsPage.qml loads successfully  
âœ… **CategorySelector** â†’ Custom component loads without naming conflicts  
âœ… **Signal Handling** â†’ Property changes emit signals automatically  
âœ… **Navigation** â†’ PageStack push/pop works correctly  

## Test Results:

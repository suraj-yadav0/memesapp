# Navigation Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed:

### 1. **Corrupted Copyright Header**
- **Problem**: The copyright header in Main.qml was corrupted with mixed code
- **Fix**: Cleaned up the header to proper format

### 2. **Missing Closing Braces**
- **Problem**: There were extra/missing closing braces causing syntax errors
- **Fix**: Balanced all braces properly for MainView, PageStack, Page, and other components

### 3. **Signal Emission in OptionSelector**
- **Problem**: OptionSelector component wasn't emitting signals when selection changed
- **Fix**: Added proper signal emission in the onSelectedIndexChanged handler

### 4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- **Problem**: Limited error handling in component creation
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive debugging and error handling for component loading

## Navigation Flow:

1. **User clicks Settings button** â†’ Triggers Action in PageHeader
2. **Component Creation** â†’ Creates SettingsPage.qml component dynamically
3. **Property Binding** â†’ Passes darkMode, selectedSubreddit, categoryNames, etc.
4. **Signal Connection** â†’ Connects darkModeChanged and selectedSubredditChanged signals
5. **Page Push** â†’ Pushes the settings page to PageStack
6. **Settings Page** â†’ Displays with OptionSelector for category selection and dark mode toggle
7. **Changes Propagate** â†’ Settings changes are sent back to Main.qml via signals

## Files Modified:

- `/home/suraj/memesapp/qml/Main.qml` - Fixed syntax errors and enhanced navigation
- `/home/suraj/memesapp/qml/components/OptionSelector.qml` - Added signal emission
- Created test script to verify navigation setup

## Navigation should now work properly! ðŸŽ‰

The settings screen will allow users to:
- Toggle dark mode on/off
- Select different meme categories/subreddits
- Navigate back to the main screen

All changes are automatically saved via the Settings component and propagated back to the main screen through proper signal handling.
